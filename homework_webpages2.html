She likes to chose the soccer ball when I practice. It is so funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!<br><br><br><br><br>
  <p>Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old. I started to go into the street to get a ball that had rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got infront of me and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. I was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been.Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!</p><hr>
